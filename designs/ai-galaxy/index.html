                context: "Post-WWII era. Turing had just helped crack the Enigma code. Computers were room-sized calculators. The question seemed absurd: could they ever think?",
                breakthrough: "Turing proposed the 'Imitation Game' - if a machine could convince a human it was human through conversation, it could be considered intelligent. This shifted the question from philosophy to engineering.",
                impact: "Established the foundational question of AI. The Turing Test remains a cultural touchstone, even as modern AI makes us reconsider what 'intelligence' means."

                breakthrough: "First time researchers formally collaborated on machine intelligence. They believed human-level AI was just 20 years away. Named the field 'Artificial Intelligence'.",
                impact: "Created AI as a distinct research field. Set ambitious goals that drove decades of research, even if the timeline was wildly optimistic."

                breakthrough: "Not a breakthrough, but a reckoning. Researchers learned AI was harder than expected. Combinatorial explosion, computational limits, and lack of common sense knowledge were real barriers.",

                breakthrough: "Not through learning or intuition, but through sheer computational power and clever pruning algorithms. Searched deeper than any human could.",
                impact: "Proved machines could exceed human performance in complex domains. But also showed the limits of pure search - it was narrow, brittle, and didn't generalize."

                breakthrough: "Introduced the Transformer architecture using self-attention mechanisms. Could process entire sequences in parallel. Scaled beautifully with more compute.",
